# hysteria2
Hysteria2 is a high-performance, UDP-based proxy and tunneling protocol designed to operate reliably on unstable, high-latency, or heavily restricted networks. Built on modern transport techniques and TLS encryption, it focuses on maintaining throughput and connection stability where traditional TCP-based solutions struggle.
